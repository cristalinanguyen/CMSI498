# Problem 1 - Greedy MAB Player

## 1. Expectations 

Our expectations from the Greedy MAB Player would be that the player quickly decides on an action that seems to give the highest reward and then continues to pursue the action that has given the highest amount of wins in the past. This would result in a graph that increases rapidly and levels out at quite a high reward (if lucky) or a low reward (if unlucky).
